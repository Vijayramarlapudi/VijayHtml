There are 2 types of operations done w.r.t functions,

1. synchronous:
2. asynchronous:


Debug JS file in html:
    
function constructor: 
can be used to create objects from a template.
Note: keys must be same in all the objects.

call: 
    calling a function from one object to another object
    Note: keys must be same in all the objects.

apply:
    this is also similir as call
    call will accepts only individual parameters, where as apply can handle an araray.
    
bind:
    this is also similir as call
    call will execute as an when we define, where as bind will execute when we call that explicitly.


Clousers: 
    the clousers are nothing but nested functions.
    clousers allows us to create private functions.


Call by value:
If we pass primitive values as arguemnts while invoking a function then 
the primitive values will be passed instead of address /reference of a variables.


Call by reference:
When we pass non primitive types as an argument to a function,
then the address/reference will be passed instedad of the value.
