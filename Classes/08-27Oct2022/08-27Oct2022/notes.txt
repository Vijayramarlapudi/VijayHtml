Datatypes:

A datatype specifies which type of data is referred in a variable.


JS provides two types of datatypes.

1.primitive types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, bigint, symbol
2.non-primitive types: arrays and object


Non-premitive types:

Arrays:

An array is a linear data structure which stores the data in sequential order.

In Js, an array can store different types of data.

Syntax:

var arr=[];

Array index starts from 0, i.e, the reference of the values stored in the array will be identified through indexes.


Problem Statement:

Create a an array that should contain a list of usernames available in database.

Get the total number of users

Get the 3rd user from an users array.


Problem Statement:

Implement a functionality to verify, whether the given username is available or not in the database.




let: is used to create a blocked level variable.

constant: we cannot assign a new value to a constant.
    
    
// Premitive Type Ex
const a=100;
a++; // Not Possible
console.log(a);

// Non Premitive Type Ex
// a value can be added to non premitive types but can not be reassigned
const aa = [1,2,3];
aa.push(100); //Possible

aa=[]  //Not Possible
console.log(aa);


Object: any realtime entity is an object.

object contains properties and actions.

Ex:

Properties of TV:
height, width, resolution, color, brand, price

Actions of TV:
on/off, increase volume, dec volume, chang channel


syntax:

var object={
    key:value
}

key must be a string and value can be of any type,

Implement logic to control a tv remote.
