DOM:

DOM stands for Document Object Model which is used to provide dynamic
nature to the web sites.

Whenever we give a html document to browser, it uses DOM to represent
each element in the form of object.

Methods:

getElementByID
getElementsByName
getElementsByTagName
getElementsByClassName
querySelector
querySelectorAll


Nodes:
Eeach element in HTML will be treated as node (object).
In DOM, we will have a root node and under root, we will have child nodes.



Navigation:
With the HTML DOM, you can navigate the node tree using node relationships.
