Control Statements:

Sequential: execute from top to bottom - if, if-else, switch
Iterative: are used to execute a set of instrction repeatedly based on conditions - while, do-while
        loop will be repeated for given number of times/elements - for, forEach
Jump: used to jump the control from one location to other - continue, break and return.



Sequential: execute from top to bottom - if, if-else, switch
If- Statement:

if(test-condition){
    //code
}

test-condition will always return a boolean value - true/false.
if the test-condtion is true, then the control enters into the block.


If-else Statement:

if(test-condition){
    //code
}
else
{
    //code
}

Switch-Statment:

swtich(choice){

    case casevalue1: code;
    case casevalue2: code;
    case casevalue3: code;
    case casevalue4: code;
    case casevaluen: code;
}
